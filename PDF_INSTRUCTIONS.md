# How to Share Your PDF Presentation

To incorporate content from your PDF presentation into the website, you have several options:

## Option 1: Upload to the Workspace (Recommended)

1. **Drag and drop** the PDF file directly into this folder (`CHORLTON_BIKES_WEBSITE`)
2. Or **copy** the PDF file to this directory using your file manager
3. Once it's here, I can read it and extract the content

## Option 2: Share via Google Drive or Dropbox

1. Upload your PDF to Google Drive or Dropbox
2. Get a shareable link (make sure it's set to "Anyone with the link can view")
3. Share the link here and I can access it

## Option 3: Extract Content Manually

If you prefer, you can:
- Copy and paste key text from the PDF
- Share specific images or slides you want included
- Describe the main points you want highlighted

Once I have access to your PDF, I can:
- Extract key information about Chorlton Bikes
