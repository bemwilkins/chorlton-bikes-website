Place your service images in this folder. All services use background images with a dark overlay and white text.

## Image Specifications:

- **Format**: JPG or PNG (both supported)
- **Size**: Any aspect ratio - the code will automatically crop and cover
- **Recommended**: Landscape orientation works best
- **File naming**: Use the exact filenames listed above (can be .jpg or .png)

## How It Works:

All service cards use background images with:
- **Image placement**: Background image appears in the top 50% of the card only
- **Dark overlay**: 50% black overlay (`rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)`) on the image section to darken it
- **White text**: Text over the image is white with subtle text shadow for legibility
- **Solid bottom section**: The call-to-action section (with email button/form) has a solid cream background (`--bg-cream`)
- **Dark text in bottom**: Text in the bottom section is dark for readability on the cream background
- **Automatic cropping**: Images use `background-size: cover` to fill the top half
- **Responsive**: Works perfectly on all screen sizes

The code handles all sizing and cropping automatically - just drop in your images!
