# Logo Files

Place your Chorlton Bikes logo files in this directory.

## Required Files

1. **logo.png** - Main logo for the navigation bar
   - Recommended size: 200px width (or height: 50px)
   - Format: PNG with transparent background
   - Color: Full color or single color version

2. **logo-white.png** (Optional) - White version for hero section and footer
   - Recommended size: 300px width
   - Format: PNG with transparent background
   - Use this if you want to display the logo in the hero section or footer

## File Naming

The website expects:
- `logo.png` in the navigation bar
- `logo-white.png` for hero/footer (if you uncomment those sections)

If your logo files have different names, update the `src` attributes in `index.html`.

## Logo Tips

- Use SVG format for best quality at any size
- Ensure logos have transparent backgrounds
- Keep file sizes under 200KB for fast loading
- Test logos on both light and dark backgrounds
