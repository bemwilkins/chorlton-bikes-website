# Hero Carousel Images

The hero section now includes an image carousel that showcases the Chorlton Bikes community.

## Image Files Needed

Place your carousel images in the `assets/images/` directory with these exact names:

- `hero-carousel-1.jpg` - Community ride scene (group of cyclists)
- `hero-carousel-2.jpg` - Cargo bike delivery
- `hero-carousel-3.jpg` - Trishaw ride
- `hero-carousel-4.jpg` - Community event/gathering
- `hero-carousel-5.jpg` - Cargo bike in action
- `hero-carousel-6.jpg` - Group cycling scene
- `hero-carousel-7.jpg` - Community cycling event
- `hero-carousel-8.jpg` - Delivery rider in action

## Image Requirements

- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **Recommended size**: 2000px width (or larger)
- **Aspect ratio**: 16:9 or similar landscape format
- **File size**: Keep under 500KB per image for fast loading
- **Content**: Images should showcase community, cycling, and the diverse work of Chorlton Bikes

## How It Works

- The carousel automatically cycles through images every 5 seconds
- Users can click the dots at the bottom to jump to specific images
- The carousel pauses when you hover over it
- If carousel images don't exist, it falls back to the original `hero-image.jpg`

## Adding Your Images

1. Export your images from your video or use the stills provided
2. Name them exactly as listed above (hero-carousel-1.jpg through hero-carousel-8.jpg)
3. Place them in the `assets/images/` folder
4. The carousel will automatically detect and use them

## Current Status

The carousel structure is ready. Once you add the image files, they will automatically appear in the carousel.
