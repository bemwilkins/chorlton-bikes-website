# Newsletter

Monthly newsletters are published as web pages and sent via Mailchimp (using Mailchimp templates). The web version is linked from the email as “Read this newsletter on the website”.

## Files per month

- **YYYY-MM.html** – Web page, e.g. `2026-01.html`, `2026-02.html`. Live at `https://chorltonbikes.coop/newsletter/YYYY-MM.html`. Use this URL in the Mailchimp campaign for the “Read on website” link.

## Images

Images live in `assets/images/newsletter/` in subfolders by month (`01-2026/`, `02-2026/`, etc.). See that folder’s README for the section → filename mapping.
